\section{How to read this document}
This document attempts to do two things
\begin{itemize}
\item Provide a starting point from which you can construct your
  report.
\item Explain how one or two useful \LaTeX\ tricks work.
\end{itemize}
This means that you actually need to read it in two ways
\begin{itemize}
\item Read a printed, or previewed version to see \emph{what} can be done.
\item Read the source to see \emph{how} it's done.
\end{itemize}
If you have any comments on this document, please post them to the QandA site
 \texttt{qanda.cs.man.ac.uk}.

\section{Aim}
\label{sec:aim}

The aim of the project is to create a wonderful gismo.

A blank line is used to separate paragraphs. The chapters, sections
and subsections are numbered and added to the table of contents
automatically.

\section{Driving Latex}

\LaTeX\ is not a WYSIWYG system. You first prepare source files,
\textsf{report.tex} etc., similar to the ones here, using your
favourite text editor.

The UNIX commands you need to drive \LaTeX\ are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{latex.} Output from \texttt{latex} can be previewed on
  the screen with \texttt{xdvi} or \texttt{gsprev} (under X), and printed on the laserprinter using  \texttt{dvips}.
  \texttt{latex} produces \textsf{.dvi} files which are used by
  \texttt{xdvi} or \texttt{gsprev} and \texttt{dvipr}.  To get all the
  cross references and the table of contents correct you sometimes
  need to run this command twice in succession.  Keep on re-running
  until the advice to rerun at the end of the output goes away.

  Many people now use \texttt{pdflatex} instead of \texttt{latex} to produce \texttt{pdf} files directly.
  
\item \texttt{xdvi} or \texttt{gsprev}. Previews the document on the
  screen, again the parameter is \textsf{report}.
  
\item \texttt{dvips.} This is used to print on the laserprinter.  The
  parameter is again \texttt{report}. 
  
\item \texttt{xfig}. Can be used to produce diagrams, see
  section~\ref{sec:diagrams}.

\end{enumerate}
There are on-line manual pages for each of the commands described above.

The set of files used to produce this document is in
\textsf{/opt/info/doc/latex} (in one of the subdirectories
\textsf{3rd-yr} or \textsf{MU-Thesis}).  They are also on the web at \url{http://csis.cs.manchester.ac.uk/software/contrib/latex/}. 

You will find that for more detailed points you will need to refer to
Lamport's `\LaTeX\ a document preparation system'~\cite{lamport}
(Copies in the library  in Blackwell's).
This example has been written using the most recent version of \LaTeX
(LaTeX2e), which is described in the \emph{2nd edition} of Lamport's
book. Buying a cheap copy of the 1st edition is probably not a good
investment. An alternative to Lamport's book, which some people
prefer, is `A guide to {\LaTeXe}' by Kopka and Daly~\cite{kopka}. The
older `A guide to {\LaTeX}'~\cite{kopka-old} by the same authors is
now obsolete. There is also pleanty of support material for \LaTeX\ on the web.

\section{Software Environment}
\subsection{Occam}

Here is some more example text, showing various \LaTeX\ facilities
you may need.  The project was mostly programmed in
\textbf{Occam}~\cite{occam}.  (A citation has been created  here to an
entry in the bibliography at the end of the report. See
chapter~\ref{cha:bib} for more details on how to do this).

Note the way of getting boldface, \textit{textit} is used for italic.
\emph{emph} is used for emphasis and is the same as italic except when
already in italic.  Note the cross reference to the bibliography.
This is how you create a footnote: DMA\footnote{Direct Memory Access.
  Footnotes can stretch over more than one line if you have a lot to
  say, but be careful not to overdo them.}.

Here is a reference to a figure. See figure~\ref{pipeline}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \input{pipeline}
  \caption{A Pipeline of processors
    \label{pipeline}}           %  this label must appear after the
                                %  \caption, and before the end of the
                                %  figure
\end{figure}
The picture in this figure was created the hard way using the picture
facility of \LaTeX. It is \emph{much} easier to use \texttt{xfig}, as
described in section~\ref{sec:diagrams}.  Whatever its contents, a
figure `floats' to a `suitable' point in the text and is never split
across a page boundary. (\LaTeX's idea of what constitutes a suitable
point may not coincide with yours)


Now we have a verbatim environment; this is a useful way of including
snippits of program, printed in a fixed width font exactly as typed:

\begin{verbatim}
{{{ An example of some folds
...  This is some folded code
  {{{ This is another fold
  This is text within the fold that has now been
  opened so that the text can be read.
  }}}
}}}
\end{verbatim}

% Everything below here is commented material which is used by the
% emacs tex support system called auctex. If you're not an emacs user
% you can safely ignore it. If you do use emacs you should take a look
% at the local emacs or LaTeX WWW pages for more on emacs support for
% LaTeX.

% mode: latex
% TeX-master: "report"
