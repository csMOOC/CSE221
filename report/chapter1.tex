\section{Goal}
In this project, we will create and apply a set of experiments to Mac OS to characterize and understand its performance. The experiments are based on four aspects : 
\begin{enumerate}
\item CPU, Scheduling, and OS Services
\item Memory
\item Network
\item File System
\end{enumerate}


After the experiment, we will gain an intuitive feel for the relative speeds of different basic operations, which is invaluable in identifying performance bottlenecks.
