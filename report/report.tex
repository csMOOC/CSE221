%% The third-rep class and this starter kit were written by

%% If you have any comments or questions regarding this document,

%% This skeleton report is organised as a master file called
%% report.tex which then includes files for individual parts including
%% abstract.tex, chapter1.tex, chapter2.tex, chapter3.tex and
%% appendix1.tex.  

%% The third-rep style is a locally created style based on the
%% standard LaTeX report style. If you really want to have a look at
%% it, its source can be found in
%% /usr/local/share/texmf/tex/latex/mancs/third-rep.cls
%%
%% More information about LaTeX in general and the local setup in
%% particular can be found on the web at

%% This is an example of how you load extra packages.
%% Some packages are already loaded in the third-rep class

\usepackage{url} % typeset URL's sensibly

\usepackage{pslatex} % Use Postscript fonts

%% The best way to latex just one chapter is to uncomment lines such as
%% the next:
%\includeonly{chapter1}

%% This defines the title (the \\ forces a line break)
\title{CSE221 Project}
%% and author
\author{Zhenchao Gan}
%% and the year of the report
\reportyear{2016}

%% The following line sets up the use of PostScript fonts rather
%% than the standard bitmapped fonts.
\usepackage{pslatex}

%% Uncomment the following line if you want to change the name of the
%% Bibliography to References
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

\usepackage{listings}

%% End of preamble, the actual document starts here
