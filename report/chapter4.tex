\section{RAM access time}
In this part, Report latency for individual integer accesses to main memory and the L1 and L2 caches.

\paragraph{Methodology}
To test memory access latency, I first followed the procedure described in the lmbench paper, testing different stride lengths over varying sizes of arrays. But it is something like sequential access, I wrote code and got the test data, found that it is hard to distinguish different level cache.

Then I choose random access as my methodology. For different array size, I iterate 1 million times, each is random access.

The overhead of random generator and iterations are about  27 cycles.

\paragraph{Predictions}
Different level caches and main memory have different access cycles.

For L1-cache, we predict hardware cycles are 5 and software 2;
For L2-cache, we predict hardware cycles are 10 and software 4;
For L3-cache, we predict hardware cycles are 15 and software 6;
For main memory, we predict hardware cycles are 30 and software 10;

\paragraph{Results}
We present our measure results.

\paragraph{Discussion}
It is easy to see the transition from L3-cache to main memory, it is very steep in the picture from array size 22 to 24. Because my L3-cache is 6MB, so it is between 22 and 24.

We can also see the transitions from L2-cache to L3-cache. In the picture, from 18 to 20, the access time increase. Because my L2-cache is 256KB, which is equal to 18 in the picture.

But I can't see the transition from L1-cache to L2-cache in the picture.

We can also see that within cache, the RAM access time cycles are very small compared to that of main memory access.
