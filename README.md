OS Systems Measurement Project

## CPU

1. To measure read time, run ./cpu1.1.out loops; To measure iteration times, run ./cpu1.2.out loops.

2. To measure procedure call overhead, run ./cpu2.1.out loops.

3. To measure system call overhead, run ./cpu3.1.out loops.

4. To measure task creation time for process, run ./cpu4.1.out loops; For kernel thread, run ./cpu4.2.out loops.

5. To measure process context switch, run ./cpu5.1.out loops; For kernel thread, run ./cpu5.2.out loops.

## Memory

1. To measure RAM access time, run ./mem1.1.out

2. To measure RAM bandwidth, run ./mem2.1.out

3. To measure page fault service time, run ./mem3.1.out

## Network

1. To measure RTT, run ./rtt_server.out port; Then run ./rtt_client.out ip port

2. To measure bandwidth, run ./bandwidth_server.out port size; Then run ./bandwidth_client.out ip port size.

3. To measure connection time, run ./conn_server.out port; Then run ./conn_client.out ip port.

## File System

1. To measure Size of file cache, run ./fs1.1.out filename.

2. To measure sequential file read time, run ./fs2.1.out filename; For random, run ./fs2.2.out filename.

3. For remote file read time, run ./fs3.1.out filename & ./fs3.2.out filename.

4. To measure contention, run ./fs4.1.out nprocess.
